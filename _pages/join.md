# Join us
Our lab always welcomes talents with a passion for science and technology. Our positions include staff scientists, engineers, postdocs, students and interns. Our lab members will have the opportunities to work with top researchers and engineers from both academia and industria. Postdocs will have their own fundings and can assemble their own research team. Graduate and undergraduate students will be working on independent research projects under supervision. Intern students will be mainly working on the engineering projects, supervised by architect with rich industrial experience.


## Staff Scientists and Engineers
For now we have two engineer positions in Hangzhou, ZJ. Please see the job description [here]().

## Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:xiaoli@aiit.org.cn). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. There are postdoc scholarship available.

## Graduate and Undergraduate Students
For now, I only co-advise graduate (Ph.D. and M.S.) and undergraduate students in my group. Students will work on their graduate thesis projects under my supervision. To apply, please send your resume and letter of intent [here](wenxue[at]unblok.net).

## Interns
Graduate and undergraduate students can also apply intern positions in my group. Those positions are different from it above, as they were mainly engineering positions. Those positions are good for students who want to go to the industry after graduation.
