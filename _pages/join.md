All application materials go [here](mailto:ting@unblok.net). We will further contact you for interviews if a good match.

### Staff Engineers
Staff engineers will mainly be working on engineering and technical aspect of our projects (mainly state-funded projects from [NSFC](http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/) or [MOST](http://en.most.gov.cn/)), with the opportunities to lead engineer teams and become investigators at AIIT.

To apply, please send your resume with a brief statement of your interest in the email.
